# FitBuddies

FitBuddies is a web application that helps users connect with other fitness enthusiasts and find workout partners. The application allows users to create an account, send friend requests by swiping on other users, search for other users, and send friend requests to connect with them. Once connected, users can view each other's workout schedules and plan workouts together. The application also provides a messaging feature that allows users to communicate with each other.

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with a knack for React. I love solving puzzles, building new things and making old things even better. 

This was my final project for Carolina Code School's Web Development immersive course. I'm still tinkering with it in my freetime and plan on making improvements to UI/UX and the algorithm that helps connect users together as my skills grow.
